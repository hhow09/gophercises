# A Virtual Filesystem Coded in Go

This is a virtual filesystem I'm coding to teach myself Go in a fun way. I'm documenting it with a collection of Medium posts that you can find <a href="https://alysonn.medium.com/my-first-go-project-a-virtual-filesystem-9b46b2fe34a"/>here</a>.
<br>
The first few steps have been working on designing the overall structure of the code and the functions I'll be making use of for the duration of the project.<br>
This doc will be expanded as I work on it over the coming weeks.

## How to use this Repo

You can get started by looking at the code in the `src` subfolder.<br>
You'll find projects marked `01, 02...` and so on.<br><br>
Each folder can be treated as a standalone version of the project as it was at time of creating it. None of them depend on each other so each can be looked at as a standalone project.<br><br>
### Step Index:
- Ex 01 - Laying the Foundation - Setting up the empty function bodies for our future work.
- Ex 02 - Creating the First Feature - Implementing user activation and prompt
- Ex 03 - Implementing a Shell.
- Ex 04 - Completing Filesystem Initialization.
- Ex 05 - Adding a Text Editor


That's the road so far.<BR><BR>

UPDATE: For now, I decided to end this project here. I ran into issues attempting to add file image writing.<BR>

## Where to see the project
This project is a collection of Medium articles I'm writing as I learn Go and build out this project. You can find the article for the code in `src/01` <a href="https://alysonn.medium.com/a-virtual-filesystem-in-go-creating-our-foundation-9af62b0e82db">here</a>
